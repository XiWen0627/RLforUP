### The Popularity of Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful machine learning paradigm, widely applied in domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making tasks. Recently, RL has garnered significant focus for its role in the training stage of large language models (LLMs). This growing impact was further recognized when AI pioneer Richard Sutton was honored with the 2025 Turing Award for their foundational contributions to RL. Concurrently, there has been a notable increase in journal articles applying RL to urban scenarios, indicating that researchers in urban science are increasingly realizing the potential of RL. 

### Bridging the Gap between RL and Urban Practice
While RL-based LLMs have demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities, facilitating the replication of RL roles in certain practical scenarios, it remians crucial for urban planners and designers to understand and leverage this advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technique. Such understanding not only facilitates the development of more effective and adaptive urban solutions but also enhances comprehension of the underlying reasoning processes, thereby expanding the practical applications of LLMs in urban contexts.
However, compared to other machine learning paradims, the multitude of concepts and  complex nature of training procedures always hinder researchers - especially those less inclined toward mathematics -  from fully understanding and applying RL. Moreover, there is a scarcity of resources that systematically explain the fundamental principles, current applications, and future developments of RL within an urban context. Our blog aims to address these gaps by providing urban planners and designers with intuitive insights into RL. We strive to demonstrate how RL can be utilized to solve spatial-related challenges and ultimately inspire the refinement of tools and the practical application of RL in urban scenarios. 

### Outline
This blog is structured into the following sections. Readers are encouraged to explore the parts that align with their interests:
- A Brief Introduction to RL.
  This section introduces fundamental concepts, core principles and the evolution of paradigm. It aims to provide some intuitive ideas for readers who are unfamiliar with RL.
- Typical RL Applications in Urban Practices.
  In this section, we showcase how RL is applied to urban research topics. Specifically, we examine studies involving scenarios such as ridesharing, facility layout optimization, and urban design generation, illustrating how RL integrates with real-world urban planning and design tasks.
- RL and LLMs.
  This section explores the role of RL in the development of LLMs and introduces some promising RL-related applications of LLMs in urban science, including LLM Agents, LLM reasoning and synthetic data.
